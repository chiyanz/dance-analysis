# dance-analysis

## About
This is an ongoing project that aims to utilize open source posture detection ML libraries and publicly available dance videos for training a program that can analyze and provide feedback on **group** dance videos. Functionalities to be included are: 
- synchronization detection
- body angle comparision
- musicality analysis 

WIP milestones:
- [ ] Training data collection
- [ ] Video compression and preprocessing
- [ ] Joint detection
- [ ] Body angle calculation 
- [ ] Posture comparison 
- [ ] Synchronization recognition 
- [ ] TBD
